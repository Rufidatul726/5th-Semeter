A notification can be sent via mail, SMS and pushNotification. Each time to notify User, an instance is created.

 A factory class NotificationFactory is created to get a Notification object and three concrete classes are implementing the Notification interface.
 
 Singleton design pattern:
 The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. So here, we let create single instance of java.
